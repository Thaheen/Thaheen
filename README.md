## Introduction

 These Days , Most parents are currently preoccupied with teaching their children and keeping track of their academic  progress.  Keeping  track  of  multiple  children  and  striking  a  balance  between all their academic levels can be difficult, especially for parents who have more than one kid. In addition, due to the lack of sufficient time for the presence of an adult who can monitor student memorization and training for recitation,students found it difficult to memorize and recite for themselves. 
 
 Thaheen(ذَھین) is a Cross Platform mobile application. It makes it easy for parents and instructors to track students’ academic level in memorization and recitation courses which could eliminate the stress for parents who do not have time to monitor their children's studies. “Thaheen”provides different interfaces for instructors,parents,and students who will be able to learn at theirown pace with a smart learning platform. The idea of " Thaheen" is in line with the realization of the Kingdom’s vision 2030 in education, which is shifting the traditional learning to digital learning to support both students and instructors, as one of the highlighted vision points.
