 These Days , Most parents are currently preoccupied with teaching their children and keeping track of their academic  progress.  Keeping  track  of  multiple  children  and  striking  a  balance  between all their academic levels can be difficult, especially for parents who have more than one kid. In addition, due to the lack of sufficient time for the presence of an adult who can monitor student memorization and training for recitation,students found it difficult to memorize and recite for themselves.
